        <h2>What is <em>Garum?</em></h2>
        <p><strong>Garum</strong> is an ancient Mediterranean sauce made of fermented fish with a strong umami flavour. It was extremely popular as a 
            condiment during ancient Roman times, some even calling it 'the ketchup of the Roman world', but it was earlier enjoyed by the Greeks.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3.5kg of small fish e.g. anchovies, sardines and mackerel</li>
            <li>1kg of salt</li>
            <li>A large jar to ferment the fish in</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut up the fish and arrange some in a layer on the bottom of a large jar, then add a layer of
                salt, then another layer of chopped fish, then another with salt until you've filled the jar.
            </li>
            <li>After you've left it for 3-4 days, start stirring the content of the jar 3-4 times a day for
                the next 3-4 months.
            </li>
            <li>
                By this point the fish should be well liquefied. Use a sieve to strain the solid parts from the
                the liquid. The liquid part is known as the <em>liquamen</em> and the solid part is known as the 
                <em>allec</em>. Both parts can be eaten, and they should both be kept in the fridge and used within
                a couple of months.

        </ol>
